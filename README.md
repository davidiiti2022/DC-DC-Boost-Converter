# DC-DC-Boost-Converter
A DC-to-DC converter is an electronic circuit or electromechanical device that converts a source of direct current (DC) from one voltage level to another. It is a type of electric power converter. Power levels range from very low (small batteries) to very high (high-voltage power transmission). In this project we will build a boost converter with the following specifications:

a) Specifications: Input 7.5 V, Output 12.5 V, Switching frequency 12 kHz, Output current 1 A.                                                                          
b) Observe Waveforms of Inductor current and switch voltage in CCM. 
c) Increase load resistance to demonstrate DCM.
